# Worked Solutions of Lessons for Web Design Lab, Spring 2017

This repository containes worked solutions in HTML and CSS as we build our example site. 

I want to stress here that this is not intended to be a signal that my solution is the correct solution! I'll be trying to use best practices in most places, I may have to go back and fix things in other places. This may change, warp, shirt: you'll be able to go back though the history and follow along,if you like. One thing I will try to do is comment everything of interest - if you see something in there that you'd like to know more about, please send me email, ask about it in lab, or raise an issue in GitHub.
